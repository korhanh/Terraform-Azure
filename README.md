# Azure Setup with Terraform

This project provides a guide for setting up and managing Azure resources using Terraform. Follow the steps below to configure and deploy your infrastructure.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Prepare Your Environment
- Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
- Use [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/features) for an easier setup.  
  _If you're not using Azure Cloud Shell, additional configurations are required._

### 2. Download the Azure Setup Script
Run the following command to download the script:
```bash
wget https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/blob/master/contrib/azure-setup.sh
3. Make the Script Executable
Set execution permissions for the script:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x azure-setup.sh
4. Run the Setup Script
For non-Azure Cloud Shell environments, run:

bash
Copy code
./azure-setup.sh setup
Follow the instructions carefully and save the output for future use.
5. Configure Your Setup
Copy the sample configuration file:

bash
Copy code
cp setup.sh.sample setup.sh
Update the setup.sh file with your environment-specific values.
6. Apply the Configuration
Source the configuration to load environment variables:

bash
Copy code
. ./setup.sh
7. Deploy Resources with Terraform
Run the following command to provision your Azure infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
