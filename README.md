## How It Works

### 1. Prepare Your Environment
- Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
- Use [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/features) for an easier setup.
  _If you're not using Azure Cloud Shell, additional configurations are required._

### 2. Download the Azure Setup Script
Run the following command to download the script:

```bash
wget https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/blob/master/contrib/azure-setup.sh
```bash

### 3. Make the Script Executable
Set execution permissions for the script:

```bash
chmod +x azure-setup.sh
```bash
